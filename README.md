# cfg_intro_to_coding_challenge_2023
winning submission to Code First Girls' Intro to Coding Challenge 2023

### *This is my team's winning submission to the February 2023 Intro to Coding Challenge hosted by [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/).*
<br/>

### <ins>The Challenge</ins>
This challenge required participants to create flowcharts and pseudocode for at least two of the following five problems:

<ins>Problem 1</ins>:<br/>
Demonstrate the workflow of identifying is a number is an admirable number or not. A whole number is admirable if the sum of proper divisors (excluding the number itself) minus two times one of the proper divisors is equal to the number.

<ins>Problem 2</ins>:<br/>
Find the next 'n' number of leap years from the current year. Here 'n' is the input taken from the user.

<ins>Problem 3</ins>:<br/>
Show the workflow of code that can tell if a number is deficient, perfect, or abundant. 
- A whole number is said to be deficient if the sum of proper divisors is less than the number. 
- A number is perfect if the sum of proper divisors is equal to the number. 
- A nuber is abundant if the sum of the proper divisors is greater than the number.

<ins>Problem 4</ins>:<br/>
Show the workflow of removing all occurrences of a given character from an input string using pseudocode and flowchart. For example, removing all "s" from "Mississippi" will return "Miiippi"

<ins>Problem 5</ins>:<br/> 
Find the second largest number in an array and demonstrate the workflow using pseudocode and flowchart.
